# Kubernetes Admin
A repository and place you can use to administer kubernetes with all of the latest and greatest tools for k8s dockerized. This repo can be used to quickly get up and running as a K8s admin without the need for a machine with the tools installed. Simply pass it a few access variables or pull them in and you're up and admining k8s in no time.

# Distro Choice
Here at nindevdo we just happen to like manjaro linux for things like tools so that's what we're using. You could use alpine and all that but manjaro is what we chose because it's fun.

# Create a cluster
`eksctl create cluster --config-file eksctl.yml`
